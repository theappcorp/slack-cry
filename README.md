# SlackCry

Send messages to Slack channels using simple, testable Crystal code ‚Äî no fuss, no complex clients.\
Supports named channel registration for easy multi-channel messaging.

---

## Features

- Send Slack messages by channel **ID** or **name**
- Configure named channels for readable, maintainable code
- Inject HTTP clients for easy mocking in tests
- Built-in error extraction and test coverage support

---

## Installation

Add to your `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  slackcry:
    github: theappcorp/slackcry
    version: ~> 1.0.0
```

Then run:

```bash
shards install
```

> Requires Crystal `>= 1.0`.

---

## Slack App Setup

To use SlackCry, you'll need a Slack app with the proper permissions and a bot token.

1. Go to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Create a new app (from scratch or manifest)
3. Enable **OAuth & Permissions**
4. Under **Scopes**, add:
   - `chat:write` (to send messages)
   - `channels:read` (optional, to read channel info)
5. Install the app to your Slack workspace
6. **Invite the bot user to any channel it should message**:
   ```bash
   /invite @your-bot-name
   ```
7. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxb-...`)
8. Set it in your environment:

```bash
export SLACKCRY_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-your-token"
```

---

## Setup

Configure named channels:

```crystal
SlackCry.configure do |config|
  config.channels = {
    "dev"     => "C1234567890",
    "alerts"  => "C2345678901",
    "support" => "C3456789012"
  }
end
```

---

## Usage

### Send to a channel by ID

```crystal
SlackCry::Msg.send_by_id("C1234567890", "Hello from SlackCry")
```

### Send to a channel by name

```crystal
SlackCry::Msg.send_by_name("alerts", "Deployment complete.")
```
